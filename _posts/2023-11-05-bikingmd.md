Our Adventures Biking Maryland

Sam and I have started to catch the biking bug. It might have been thanks to YouTube's algorithm which wove its way from geography videos to a cross-country biking duo that captured Sam's attention (shout out to <a href="https://youtu.be/V-yO1DcdUFQ?si=HM3OMyACcIRl0bdz" target="_blank"> Hackisoutthere</a>). Sam didn't realize that it was possible to bike across countries and sleep in tents while visiting villages. Needless to say, he started asking what mountain bikes and road bikes were and how they were different. A short ride on a hybrid bike and a conversation about the diffrent bike types had him convinced that a road bike would make him even faster and able to cover more ground.

I picked up a used 1970s steel Schwinn knock-off road bike with a front emblem saying it was made in Japan with Schwinn approved gear shifters and brakes. After new tires, tubes, seat, and some elbow grease on the rusty spots, it was in working order. A fancy new aluminum road bike that is just about 1-2 inches too tall for Sam's slender frame arrived in the mail a week later.

We hit the road (Sam a few more times than myself) by doing loops around our neighborhood and venturing out to local restaurants for fast food. After our super exciting 2-mile trips for food, it was time to find some more intermediate biker level paths.

There is a bike path near us called the WB&A trail. Unfortunately, it stops at the Patuxent River on the east side and route MD 450 in Glendale on the west side. The approximately 5-mile paved path is fairly level, well maintained, and perfect riding conditions on cool fall mornings. Once you get to the beginning of the trail, there is a nice warm spot to take in some hot chocolate and rest your legs.

We did the full trail both ways which ended up being over 13 miles when you factor in some time getting there and back. Having some sugar half way made the trip back easier than the trip out. Don't worry, we took some time to smell the stagnant ponds and take in the scenery along the way.

The next day, we wanted to do another trip. It turns out there is something called the East Coast Greenway (see resources below). It is a combination of dedicated path and bike-friendly roads/sidewalks that stretch from Maine to Florida and happens go nearly right across our front yard. So on day two, we ventured out for another 10-mile or so bike ride in the opposite direction. Warning to hard-core bikers: areas along route 197 are nearly covered with leaves and the path is very bumpy. This stretch of path is not idea for road tires and no suspension.

This biking is so much fun. Don't forget to stop and climb some really big hills.
