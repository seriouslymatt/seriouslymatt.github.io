## The Skywatcher Classic 200P

I had never used a Newtonian Reflector until we bought this telescope. I was strictly a refraction telescope user and didn't move much past the moon. Everything else in the sky was just a bright dot from my perspective. 

Enter the Skywatcher Classic 200P. As you can see, this is not your father's hand-me-down telescope. It has an 8" inner diameter extending 1200mm to the primary mirror and then back up to the secondary mirror. With the 20mm eyepiece, that gives you 60x zoom and with the 12mm eyepiece you get 100x zoom.

## The Results

Sam has a few images taken with his phone camera using a camera mount. I am waiting for a mount to connect my mirrorless digital camera. Images will be forthcoming.
