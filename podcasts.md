I have been an avid podcast listener probably since around the 2008 time-frame. They have provided a wealth of information and guidance to me over the years. I particularly enjoy how following a few key podcasters establish connections to other people and topics of interest. This leads one to follow interesting people on Twitter, read interesting books, listen to the authors on other podcasts, and eventually have a deep connecting web of experts in the field to follow.

One of the key features of podcasts is their open environment. Most podcasts are free or ad-supports and distributed through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS" target="_blank">RSS</a> such that any podcast player can download them as new episodes are published. I do not support any podcasts that are limited to certain companies such as Spotify or Apple. I believe "walled-off" platforms are an affront to the free and open web and encourage others not to support their attempt to monopolize podcasts.

Below is a list of my favorite podcasts that I keep in my queue. They are dry. Some lack "production" quality. They are long. But on the positive side, they are extremely informative, discuss broad topics, and attempt to bring about positive change.
