Daily Thoughts

11/02/2024: How does one get grandparents to use password managers?

10/19/2024: Went to the bayhouse to visit my parents. We did something fun and wacky which was to find every "bird" item in the bayhouse and line them up on the pier for a parade. <a href="seriouslymatt.com/weird-and-wacky/" alt="Link to Image of Weird and Wacky page" target="_blank">Weird and Wacky Page</a>It was fun and Mimi was surprised. 65 bird items. Also went out for Vietnamese food at Cafe Sodo for anniversary dinner.

10/18/2024: I want to write more and maybe doing a short daily thought on my website would help inspire more writing, thinking, and blogging.
