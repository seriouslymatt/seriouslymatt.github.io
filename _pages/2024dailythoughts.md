Daily Thoughts

10/18/2024: I want to write more and maybe doing a short daily thought on my website would help inspire more writing, thinking, and blogging. 

10/19/2024: Went to the bayhouse to visit my parents. We did something fun and wacky which was to find every "bird" item in the bayhouse and line them up on the pier for a parade. <a href="seriouslymatt.com/weird-and-wacky/" alt="Link to Image of Weird and Wacky page" target="_blank">Weird and Wacky Page</a>It was fun and Mimi was surprised. 65 bird items. Also went out for Vietnamese food at Cafe Sodo for anniversary dinner.

10/20/2024: Happy Anniversary. I was frustrated today trying to get a simple html static website designed for this site. It is difficult settling for a theme or style and then trying to adjust it to my liking. I know I can tweak it later, but it is difficult leaving it hanging.

10/21/2024: We decided to start up family shabbats once a month again. I sent out an email to the family getting it going. It is a lot of work those days preparing the food and the tables, but it is important. I know the driving here isn't easy on everyone either.
